### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

My name is José and I'm a Portuguese :portugal: Software Developer.

I'm currently studying at 42 Lisboa :man_technologist: and I'm always looking to learn new things, for example, just 2 years ago I learned what a main function is for...yep, I had never coded until 2021 :eyes:

When I'm not in front of the screen, you can catch me playing Padel, whenever I can find 3 other people to play with that is...are you up for a game by any chance? :tennis:

I also have an Hotel Management Degree, and worked in a hotel in Hong Kong for 6 months :hong_kong:
